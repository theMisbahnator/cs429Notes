Introduction to C
- no objects in c
- represention of bytes stay the same when casting, the container size just changes
- when casting from a long to a int, since there is a 32 bit size difference, data can be cut off and lost
- u can not automatically free up space like java, use free(x); to manage memory 

Pointers
- * means pointer, star is apart of the syntaz not the name
- malloc means the allocation of memory 
- creating an array of size 5
	- int *arr = malloc(sizeof(int) * 5);
	- int arr[5];
- &variable gets the reference of a variable
	- thats allows the modification of the variable by changing its memory
	- you need to dereference the pointer by doing * again.
- struct is like an boject but contains data type and no methods
- pointers are always 8 bytes
