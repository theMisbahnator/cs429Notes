Lecture 10, Floating Point Data
- floating point numbers are NOT real numbers
    - only have a finite number
- cant store numbers like plankcs constnt or avagadros number
- we have 11/2 -> 5.5 -> (101.1)base 2, terminates
- we have 1/10 -> (.1) -> (1.001100110011...)2 only terminates in one base
- we have 1/3 -> .33333... -> (.01010101...) base 2, non terminating
