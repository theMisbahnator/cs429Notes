lecture 11 --- floating point
Pattern for subnormal
- 0 (0^8) (1 0^22)2
- largest sub normal - sig field will be all ones = 2^-126 - 2^-149
- the smallest will have all 0's and a 1 at the end.

infinites
- pattern to prepresent infinit from +/- nMax
- 0 1^p 0 ^p-1 positive infinity 
- 1 1^p 0 ^p-1 negative infinity

- What are the results of 1/0, 1/infinity, infinity + infinity
    - well defined 
- infinity - infinity, 0 * X, 0/0.
    - ill defined or not defined
- IEEE responses is that this chould return NaN 
- use the unused representations
- NaN are unordered, and cant compare to NaN for inequality

Comparing floats
- first look at sign bit, the next thing u check is the exponent, then the sign
- Treat as an int and comparing it faster than using bit operations

Point Data
- muliplication of floats are easy, addition is a lot harder for different exponenets
- do infinite resision arithmatic, the round
- representation of finite subset is FF(p, q);
- every real number is sanwiched between floating point numbers
- if x !e of FF(p,q) one of these two things must be true
    - x is outside the normailized range 2^130 and 2^-130
    - x is within normalized range but requires more than p bits to represent the significand
    - ex 1 + 2^(-25)
go the next one and ping the next place by 4

 - 4 rounded functions
 - Round down -> x_
 - rund up -> x+
 - round to 0 -> based on -+ round up or down
 - round to nearest, wherever x is closer to x_ or x+
