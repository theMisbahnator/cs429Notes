character data
c's type system
- object means variaable
- the conteents of which can represent values
 two types
 basic types
    - void type
        - empty set of values
    - arithmetic typyes
        -  integer: char, short, int, long, enum  
        -  floating: float, double, long double
 derived types
    - array types
    - fnction types
    - pointer types 
    - structure types
    - union types

character type
- are large enoguh to store any number of ececution character set
= in all cases, its sizeof is always 1 byte, there no byte ordering issue
- the language standard does not specify the coding, the moset common encoding is ascii

ascii encoding
- bit batters 0x00 and 0x7f to control character \n
- 0x20 - 0x7E are printable characters
- range is codespace, and the patters is called a code point

operations on characters
- are integral for data types
- arithmetic operations are permitted
- thuer results may or maynot be meaningful

unicode
- expansion of acii to inlcude emojis and more scripts
- support is uneven

utf-8 encoding
- -bit unicode tranformation format
- variable length character encoding capable of encoding all valid code points 
- uses 1,2, 3, or 4 bytes
- any ascii character has the same exact coding in utf-8
