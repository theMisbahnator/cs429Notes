Term Paper:
- 6 papers + 1 podcast to help
- Come up of a definition of what makes a system and what doesnt make a system.
- Due on October 12, checkpoint (first draft) on september 17 (<= 1000 content words)

Value vs Representation
- Multiple ways to represent a value
- Different contexts = different representations
- representations can have multiple values, ex. bengali 4 is an 8
- Data types can add the context to interpret a representation
	- ex. 11001001 can be 201 as binary or some String from star trek

Summary
- We always work with the concrete representation
- Representation dictates alorithms that operate on that data type
- the type system of programming language provides the rules used to interprets a vaiable

What Makes a Bit
- Bit = binary (two) + digit (finger/toe)
- Entity with two distinct states: 1 (line) and 0 (circle)
- bistable device
	- light bulb
	- sound: short tap vs long tap, morse code
	- braille: raised dot vs smooth region of paper
	- punch card: presence of hole vs absence of hole
