429 lecture 8 - operating on integers

- ripple care algo in base 2
- this is a leetcode problem, when your each to, put down a 0 and carry the 1

101 + 110 = 1011

- full adder = three input, two output circuit.

w-bit ripple carry adder
- you have a bit vector and b bit vector, and you get
- the sum bit vector and the over bit v
- V = c w-1, for unsigned, and v = c w-1 xOR C w-2
- representation based bit addition
- in both cases, prime the pump, having the least sig bit having 0.

subtraction
- just addtion using RCAw
- adding negative b to a
- a - b -> a + -b
- -b -> ~b + 1
- the one can be used at c-1, the lest sig bit

Multiplication
- repeated addition

unsigned Multiplication
- 2w bits to represent
- regular multipl (mod 2^w)

signed
- twos complement, shift of range
- up to 2w bits

multi by constants
- for 0<= k < w, 
    - multiply 2 * k = x << k
    - shifts and add 
    - x * 14 = x*8 + x*4 + x * 2 == (x << 3) + (x << 2) + (x << 1) == (x << 4) - (x << 1)
