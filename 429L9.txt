429L9 --- lecture operting on integers

6 tools for bit hacking

guidlines;
- integer rep are twos cpomplement,
- right shifts of signed values are arithmetic
- bata type contains 32 bits
- see all bit-level and logical operations
- CANT using conditionals, loops, switches, macros, div, mod, .... ONLY representations

1) bit parallel operations
- use & | and ~ along with discrite math from things like basic equivielcies etc...
- ex: x & y
    - x & y using only ~ and |
    - ~(!x | ~y)
- swapping values of x and y without using a temporary
    - x ^= y = x ^= y;
    - is equal too:
    - x = x ^ y;
    - y = y ^ x;
    - x = x ^ y; 

2) masking
- boolean identities -> x & 1 = x, x | 0 = x, x | 1 = 1;
- example: extract the least sig byte of x
    - return x & 0xFFU
- add corresponding bytes of x and y
    - s = (bro copy this from the slides)

3) shifting
- shifting bytes to bring certian bits into desired positions
- examples: extract MSB of x
    - for 32 bits, shift 3 bytes to the right, then do the same operation to extract
        the least significant bit
    - just shift enough to make the MSB be in the spot of the least sig Bit positional
    - x >> ((sizeof(int) - 1) << 3) & 0xFFU
    - example: wrap around vals when shifting to fill vacant positions
        - well i zoned out
4) recursive doubling
- parallel sum/reduction/scan
- breaks up work intp peices in parallel
- continues thier result using associtive operator
- reduce time complexity from o(n) to o(lgN)
- n is number of bits like w
- example: take a word and count the number of ones in it 
    - merge sort type seperation
    - take the sum of neighboring positions and accumulate the result to the top 
    - use bit wise parallel to use concurrency
    - u gotta watch the recoding for this as well
    - see patternf in 1, 2, 4, 8, logarithmic number of steps

5) structured permutations
- overleaving where no card is in valid position
- moving the bits in a structured manner 
- bit reversal
    - unsigned int x
- outer perfect shuffle, inner perfect shuffle

6) lookup table
- precompute values to prevent the recomputation 
- still need to control the size of the lookup table
- tectual subsitution, get a value of n, write out sub string
